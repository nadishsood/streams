How to not navigate with react router.

Don't use anchor tags to route between components. Because web browser dumps old html/js/data and
reloads. See the network monitor in chrome. 

link tag prevents the page from getting reloaded when navigating in our application. 
SPA - clicking on links and moving around but using the same index.html, not getting it again and again. 

Always visible components: 
    just add that component outside the browser router. It'll always be shown 
    regardless of the route we are on. 

    we later move header inside the browserrouter but withut a path so it will still be always visible. 
    We do this because otherwise <link> can not be used outside of router.

//gapi.load is used to fetch in the additional js code and load it into the library. 
//gapi now gets more functions available on it. 
//init is also an asynchronous function
//load - have to use a callback object, init - returns a promise, therefore can use then

//window.gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance() returns an authentication object. 
//isSignedIn in the state is null - we dont know whether or not a user is signed in. 

//google auth holds authentication between refreshes. 
//earlier we had to refresh page to change the signed in not signed in text, 
but that should happen automatically. 
 this.auth.isSignedIn.listen(this.onAuthChange); will change the text automaticallty.
