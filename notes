How to not navigate with react router.

Don't use anchor tags to route between components. Because web browser dumps old html/js/data and
reloads. See the network monitor in chrome. 

link tag prevents the page from getting reloaded when navigating in our application. 
SPA - clicking on links and moving around but using the same index.html, not getting it again and again. 

Always visible components: 
    just add that component outside the browser router. It'll always be shown 
    regardless of the route we are on. 

    we later move header inside the browserrouter but withut a path so it will still be always visible. 
    We do this because otherwise <link> can not be used outside of router.
